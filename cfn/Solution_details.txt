1. Requests sent to the application should return “Hello Onica” and image file
2.  Application will scale based on CPU consumption and threshold define as 10.
3. The bash script in crontab, every 5 min, sends the /var/logs/httpd/access_logs to the S3 bucket
4. Application VMs are not publicly accessible
5.  I added s3 access all role to ec2 instances, but got some issue in uploading files to S3, otherwise script logic and lifecycle seems ok
6.  Logs in S3 bucket compressed daily (at midnight logs are zipped on all VMs, uploaded to S3, and raw logs are removed daily)
7.  The compressed Logs have lifecycle of 30 days
8. Code is commited in my github repository.



● Excellent outcome, we are in for a long term contract with your company:
○ You managed to save our “go live” date and fixed the site : YES
○ You fixed our template and we have a repeatable and reliable way to deploy our site globally anytime : YES
○ You implemented the missing piece of infrastructure responsible for logs compression : Partial (need more time to debug the issue with VM uploading files on S3)
